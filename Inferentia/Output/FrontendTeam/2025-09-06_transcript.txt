Good morning everyone. Today we are here to finalize our marketing plan for Q4. First,  Michael will draft the promotional email sequence by next Tuesday. Anshara should update the  social media calendar with our new campaign themes. We need to follow up the design team on the  info graphic by Friday. We discussed increased the advertising budget by 15% and it was  agreed and will allocate an extra 10 grand or $10,000 from the general fund. We have decided to  postpone the webinar until November 10 to give us more time for promotion. On the product side,  John will coordinate with engineering to ensure the beta feature is ready for the October 25th launch.  Please remember to send your weekly status updates by end of the day every Thursday. That's all  for now. Thanks theme.
