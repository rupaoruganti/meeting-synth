Good morning everyone. Today we are here to finalize our Q4 marketing plan and initial product tasks. Michael will draft the promotional email sequence by next Tuesday to kick off customer engagement. Anshara should update the social media calendar with the new campaign themes by Friday so that posts are aligned with the brand guidelines. John will coordinate with the design team to ensure the infographic is completed and delivered on time. Lisa will prepare the first draft of the press release by October 10, while Neha provides design assets to match the media kit. Priya will begin reviewing the beta feature for functionality and will submit her initial test findings by Monday. Karan will gather analytics from last quarterâ€™s campaigns and share insights on customer behavior by Wednesday. Sam is tasked with preparing the first version of the sales playbook so the sales team has guidance ahead of the product launch. The team has agreed to increase the advertising budget by 15% and an extra \$10,000 has been allocated from the general fund specifically for digital advertising. We also agreed to postpone the webinar until November 10, allowing more time for effective promotion. Michael and Anshara will coordinate on scheduling posts for this event, and John will provide banner updates for the landing page. All members are reminded to send weekly status updates by Thursday evening. The main objective is to ensure that tasks are completed on time without bottlenecks. This meeting sets the foundation for the Q4 roadmap, and everyone left clear about their responsibilities.
