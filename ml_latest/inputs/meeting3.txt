Today’s meeting was focused on preparing for the beta feature launch. John confirmed that engineering has fixed the issues Priya highlighted and a new build will be ready for testing tonight. Priya will conduct regression testing over the next two days to ensure no new bugs have surfaced. Michael reported that the email campaign sequence has been finalized and scheduled to go live next Tuesday. Anshara confirmed that the social media posts promoting the launch have been queued and banners from Neha are already uploaded. Lisa said the press release is complete and awaiting executive approval, expected by tomorrow. Karan shared updated metrics on ad performance and recommended doubling the LinkedIn budget for better ROI. The team discussed and approved this adjustment. Sam presented a near-final version of the sales playbook and agreed to integrate Lisa’s updated messaging. Neha also showed updated creative designs for the webinar landing page. The group agreed to begin A/B testing on that page next week. The advertising budget is being tracked closely and John will provide a spend update every Monday. The team agreed to hold a mid-sprint checkpoint on October 19 to review launch readiness. Everyone acknowledged their deliverables and the meeting ended with a clear focus on ensuring the beta release and campaign launch happen smoothly without delays.
