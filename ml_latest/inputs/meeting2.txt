Hello team, today’s meeting focuses on progress updates and addressing any roadblocks. Michael confirmed that the first draft of the promotional email sequence is nearly complete and will be circulated tomorrow. Anshara updated the group that the social media calendar has been revised with campaign themes and posts are scheduled for the next two weeks. John reported that the design team delivered a draft of the infographic but some adjustments are needed, and Neha will assist with revisions. Lisa shared that the press release draft is ready but requires input from Sam regarding product positioning before finalization. Priya shared her QA findings and flagged two issues in the beta feature which John will coordinate with engineering to fix by Friday. Karan presented last quarter’s campaign analytics, highlighting strong performance in LinkedIn ads but weaker results on Instagram. Based on this, Michael suggested reallocating part of the ad budget towards LinkedIn and the team agreed. Sam mentioned that the sales playbook is halfway done, but he needs product details from John to finalize it. The webinar preparations are underway, and Lisa confirmed the registration form will be tested by Monday. Everyone was reminded again about weekly updates and to flag blockers early. The team is making progress, though attention is needed on the beta fixes and the infographic revision. The meeting closed with each member reaffirming their tasks and timelines for the week.
