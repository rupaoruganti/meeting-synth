The meeting today centered around risk review and next steps for launch readiness. Priya reported that regression testing revealed one more bug related to user login, which John promised engineering would fix within 24 hours. Michael noted that the email campaign system is set up but asked Lisa to review the subject lines for tone and clarity. Anshara showed that the social media calendar is fully updated through October 30 and includes multiple posts about the webinar. Karan recommended testing different ad creatives to maximize engagement, and Neha volunteered to provide two alternate versions by tomorrow. Sam said that the sales playbook is now finalized, but training materials are still pending, which he will prepare by October 22. Lisa confirmed that the press release has been approved and scheduled to go out alongside the product announcement. The group discussed webinar promotion and agreed that registration ads should begin running by Monday. John reminded everyone that the budget must be strictly monitored, especially since more funds have been shifted to LinkedIn campaigns. Michael suggested adding a feedback form link in the emails to gather user reactions, and the team agreed. The checkpoint on October 19 remains fixed, and all owners are expected to come with updated reports. Everyone agreed that while a few issues remain, the overall project is on track for the October 25th launch.
